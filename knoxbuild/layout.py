"""Turn a footprint rectangle into a furnished floor plan.

Wall model, which the rest of the package depends on: BuildingEd stores walls on
the north and west *edges* of tiles, which is why its per-floor tile grids are
(width+1) x (height+1). So for a building w tiles wide and h tall:

    north exterior wall   y = 0,  dir N,  x in 0..w-1
    west  exterior wall   x = 0,  dir W,  y in 0..h-1
    south exterior wall   y = h,  dir N
    east  exterior wall   x = w,  dir W

Interior walls appear automatically wherever two adjacent tiles hold different
room indices, so we only ever paint rooms - we never emit wall objects.
