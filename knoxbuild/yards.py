"""The front and back of every house: path, stoop, drive, mailbox, bin, fence.

Knox County's houses have all of these and generated ones stood in unbroken
lawn with the front door opening onto grass. The door is only known once the
building is laid out, after the terrain was drawn, so they are painted into
the terrain and vegetation bitmaps here, starting from the renderer's
untouched copy of the ground (<map>_ground_base.bmp) so that building again
does not keep old paths. Back-yard fences are returned as lines for the fence
builder (knoxbuild/fences.py).

Measured on the vanilla map's outdoor squares: stone slabs
(floors_exterior_tilesandstone_01) are its commonest outdoor floor after
grass, dark tarmac drives the next, then wooden fences.
