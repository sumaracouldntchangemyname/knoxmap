"""What a building's surroundings say it is.

OSM rarely tags what a building is used for: in the town this was built on,
3015 of 3079 buildings were plain building=yes. The land they stand on is
tagged far more often - an industrial estate, a school's grounds, a hospital
site, a cemetery - and a building inside one of those is almost always part of
it. Reading that turns an anonymous box on an industrial estate into a works,
and the shed in a schoolyard into part of the school, instead of the suburban
house every untagged building used to become.
