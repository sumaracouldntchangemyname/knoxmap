    Tiles are square, so a street at 20 degrees becomes a staircase with a step

    that grid runs along the tiles straightens every street on it. Buildings,
    fences and the paper map are projected the same way, so nothing is

    and cells whose local grid is within DISTRICT_CLUSTER_DEG of one another

    neither, so both districts stayed staircases. Now the district with the
